        <p class="description">
          Jordan Bernt Peterson (born 12 June 1962) is a Canadian professor of
          psychology, clinical psychologist, YouTube personality, and author. He
          began to receive widespread attention in the late 2010s for his views
          on cultural and political issues, often described as conservative and
          a member of the intellectual dark web. Born and raised in Alberta,
          Peterson obtained bachelor's degrees in political science and
          psychology from the University of Alberta and a PhD in clinical
          psychology from McGill University. After teaching and research at
          Harvard University, he returned to Canada in 1998 to permanently join
          the faculty of psychology at the University of Toronto. In 1999, he
          published his first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief,
          which became the basis for many of his subsequent lectures. The book
          combined information from psychology, mythology, religion, literature,
          philosophy, and neuroscience to analyze systems of belief and meaning.
          In 2016, Peterson released a series of YouTube videos criticizing the
          Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code (Bill
          C-16), passed by the Parliament of Canada to introduce "gender
          identity and expression" as a prohibited grounds of discrimination. He
          argued that the bill would make the use of certain gender pronouns
          into compelled speech, and related this argument to a general critique
          of political correctness and identity politics. He subsequently
          received significant media coverage, attracting both support and
          criticism. Afterwards, Peterson's lectures and
          conversations—propagated especially through podcasts and
          YouTube—gradually gathered millions of views. He put his clinical
          practice and teaching duties on hold by 2018, when he published his
          second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. Promoted with a
          world tour, it became a bestseller in several countries. Throughout
          2019 and 2020, Peterson's work was obstructed by health problems in
          the aftermath of a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. In 2021,
          he published his third book, Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, and
          returned to active podcasting.
